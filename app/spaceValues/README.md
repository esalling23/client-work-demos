# Space Values Demo

This demo contains a subset of code for the Space Values game, developed for an educational client for a math game platform. The project showcases dynamic drag-and-drop game mechanics designed to teach foundational math concepts through number-combining gameplay.

Code has been modified slightly to protect client IP platform.
