# Client Work Demos

This repository contains a set of games built with React.js, Redux, Context API, Lottie.js, and GSAP for an educational client company. 

> All assets & code not written by myself have been moved out of this repo to protect artist & client IP. 
> Some features and content including game levels, player progression, and student feedback including voice-over have been removed or significantly reduced to protect client IP. 

## Role and Responsibilities

As the **Engineering Lead** on these projects, I worked directly with the design and content teams to establish and refine gameplay mechanics. In addition to writing the majority of the code for the games, I managed feature and bug ticket prioritization and resolution while overseeing a team of engineers from conception to product delivery.

High Level Contributions:
- Led rapid prototyping, feature implementation and game mechanic refinement, and testing phases for each game. 
- Wrote and maintained internal documentation for development, deployment, and delivery processes for the client for use for future contracts. 
- Oversaw and onboarded new team members, including helping them resolve bugs, communicate effectively with the client, and follow client procedures. 
- Defined and documented internal development code style and standardization across games and started a new internal code review process to improve the quality of client deliveries and continue to secure new game contracts. 

Nitty Gritty: 
- Implemented a combination of Redux & Context API to manage game state, split into 4 reducers. 
- Collaborated with art team to improve animation performance and establish patterns that supported easy variation through JSON data parsing & live asset replacement. 
- Utilized GSAP/GreensockJS for on-the-fly animations and LottieJS for pre-built animations
- Protected asset access using AWS S3 and a bucket policy to grant access to set referrers
- Built unique interactive game environments including drag-and-drop functionality, parallax scrolling backgrounds, screen-responsive
